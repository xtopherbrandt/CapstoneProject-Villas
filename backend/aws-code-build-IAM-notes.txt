Have two policies for Code Build:
- CodeBuildBasePolicy-Villas-backend-python-us-west-2
- CodeBuildBasePolicy-Villas-direct-build-us-west-2

These are created and sort of managed by the build project. If changes are made to the build project environment,
like adding or changing Environment Variables, then need to delete these policies and allow the build project to
recreate them (it's stupid).

The main issue is that in order for the build to run docker build it needs extra permissions. This extra permission has
been put into the ECR_Docker_Build policy which has been added to the codebuild-Villas-backend-python-service-role
